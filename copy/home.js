    blurb:
      "Currently, I’m studying <em>Computer Engineering</em> at the <em>University of Waterloo</em>. This past fall, I’ve been interning as a Software Engineer at Intel, working on their FPGA based Deep Learning Accelerator. I’ll be graduating in Winter 2022.<br/><br/>For the last few years of my undergrad, I’ve been on the <em>Dean’s Honours List</em>. I also have an affinity for research, as I’ve worked as a Research Assistant under Professor Wojciech Golab in Winter 2019. Here I used numerical analysis to estimate the total energy consumption used by a household. In my freetime, I enjoy reading Fantasy Fiction such as the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> series, and playing board games with friends. Reach out if you want to hear more about my interests, research, or board game suggestions.",
